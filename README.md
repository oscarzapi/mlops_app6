In this project, we have built a Django backend to provide ML predictions from a React web app served in ngnix server.
The project is structured in 4 folders:
- frontend-ui: containing all react dependencies.
- mlops_app6: containing all libraries related to the virtual environment used here.
- model: containing a python notebook, data and modelPipeline file generated to be used by the backend server.
